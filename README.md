angular-scroll-progress-meter
=============================

A simple AngularJS directive to update the width CSS property of an element based on scroll position within another element.

##Dependencies##

* jQuery
* Lo-Dash (or Underscore)

Probably only really useful if you happen to be using these frameworks in your project. If not, you may be better of rolling your own to avoid somewhat large dependencies for just a little functionality (for now, at least).
